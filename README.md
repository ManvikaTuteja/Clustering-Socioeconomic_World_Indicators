# Clustering-Socioeconomic_World_Inicators
An analysis of various socioeconomic indicators for over 200 countries. 

In this project I am analyzing a data-set that looks at various socioeconomic parameters for nearly 200 countries. The analysis and subsequent analysis is divided on the basis of three major criterion:

1. Business 
    1. Ease of doing business (using Business Tax Rate, Days to start business)

2. Health 
    1. Impact of Health Expenditure as a % GDP on Infant Mortality Rate 
	 2. Influence of Health Expenditure/Capita on Life Expectancy for Males and Females 

3. Development of a country 
    1. GDP vs. Working class of a country (primarily the % of population between the ages of 15-64)
    2. % of Urban Population in countries vs. the mobile usage and internet usage in that country 
    3. % of population between the ages of 15-64 and the internet usage for those countries
